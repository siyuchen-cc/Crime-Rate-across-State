# Crime-Rate-across-State

## Motivation
Violent crimes, including robbery, aggravated assault, sexual assault, and murder, has always been a nationwide concern in this country. In 2019, the number of violent crimes reported in the US was 1.2 million - a 3% decline from the previous year. Though, in generally, there’s a decreasing trend in violent crimes across the country; for some cities, we can still see a spike in crimes. For example, the crime rate in Chicago keeps surging for the past few years, and it created huge concerns related to public safety. Crime diverse across states and counties. Therefore, it is important to understand how crime levels differs among different communities, and also the underlying reason behind it. What factors impact crime rate in the US?

In this project, I want to estimate the divergence of crime rate for different states. By exploring demographic characteristics across state and county, I intend to explain whether unemployment rate and income are associated with crimes rate. I also want to delve into specific types of crimes to see if there’s any type of crime that contributes most to crimes issue.

Therefore, I aim to explain the following three questions:
• What’s the general crime rate situation for United States? Which state has highest crime rate, and which has the lowest crime rate?
• Is crime rate correlated with socio-economic factors: median household income and unemployment rate?
• Is drug a primary issue for high crime rate?
